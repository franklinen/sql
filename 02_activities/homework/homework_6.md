**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous work on machine learning models, the focus was primarily on optimizing performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, but incorporating ethics and equity is equally essential to ensure fair and responsible AI development. Reflecting on projects like customer churn prediction and Term Deposit aquisition, one adjustment would be to rigorously evaluate whether the data used contains biases that disproportionately affect certain groups. For example, I would analyze if the dataset had underrepresented demographics and ensure that the models do not reinforce these disparities through biased predictions.

Another important adjustment would be to implement fairness-aware algorithms that mitigate biased decision-making in the models. This could involve techniques like re-weighting or re-sampling the data to ensure equitable representation, and using fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds alongside traditional performance metrics. Furthermore, in model validation, I would apply a comprehensive approach that includes evaluating the model's fairness across different demographic groups, particularly in critical decision-making scenarios such as loan approvals or marketing outreach.

To sustain an ethical and equitable approach, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of deployed models would be essential. Regular audits to assess the impact of AI systems on different populations, along with continuous engagement with stakeholders, would help identify potential harms and biases as they emerge. This proactive strategy would ensure that the models remain not only technically robust but also socially responsible, contributing to fairer outcomes in the long term.
