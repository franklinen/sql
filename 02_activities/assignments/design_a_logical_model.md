# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

Architecture 1 is type 1 and Architecture 2 is type 2. Type 2 retains old customer address while Type 1 overwrites it.

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?

Privacy Implications
There are potential privacy implications when retaining customer address history, especially for Type 2:

If the data is mishandled, exposed, or used inappropriately. For instance, outdated addresses might expose sensitive past information such as previous residences.

Depending on the jurisdiction, storing historical addresses may require compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA. These regulations give users the right to request deletion or access to their personal data, including past addresses.

Privacy laws often encourage businesses to follow the principle of data minimizationâ€”storing only the data necessary for operational purposes. Retaining multiple historical addresses unless thereâ€™s a clear business justification (e.g., for fraud prevention, auditing) might be seen as excessive.

In light of privacy considerations, itâ€™s important to assess the need for storing historical address data. Type 1 (overwriting addresses) might be preferable for minimizing privacy risks unless thereâ€™s a clear operational need to track address history, in which case proper security measures should be implemented for Type 2.

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
The Adventtureworks Schema is more elaborate than my ERD. 

The Adventureworks Schema divides the tables in color codes and I may want to change that in my ERD
